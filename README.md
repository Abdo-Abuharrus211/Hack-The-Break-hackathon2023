# CodeGoals

## What it does
CodeGoals generates ideas for personal projects tailored to individual students' programming knowledge, skill level, and personal interests.

## How we built it
We build CodeGoals using html, javascript, and CSS. Most tasks were handled collaboratively, but we had some group members who handled more ideation and some who handled more implementation.

## Challenges we ran into
At the beginning, we tried to use some express.js to work on skills some of us are still a bit uncomfortable with, but we ended up settling on using static pages to keep things simple given the time crunch.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to put together something presentable in a short amount of time, how were able to come together and collaborate on an idea that was new to all of us, and how we handled dividing up and tacking ideas and tasks. Also, we are proud that just a few months ago, some of us didn't know much about coding (if anything at all)! Finally, we are proud of persevering even though we are all quite burned out from school work.

## What we learned
We learned how intensive the process of creating an idea is versus actually implementing it. Both take time, and both are their own beast to tackle! We also learned about the importance of time management, communication, and project management. Furthermore, we had the chance to experience agile methods as a powerful process of trying, testing, and going back for alterations. We also learned when to cut our losses for the sake of time.

## What's next for CodeGoals
What's next for us? Definitely sleep. Also, we hope to integrate a back end for this app so that we can save users' generated ideas, and explore how an app like this might best be monetized.
